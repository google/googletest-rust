    /// The trait implementation defines what it means to "match". Often the
    /// matching condition is based on data stored in the matcher. For example,
    /// `eq` matches when its stored expected value is equal (in the sense of
    /// the `==` operator) to the value `actual`.

    /// `matcher_result` is `DoesNotMatch`.
    ///
    /// The function should print a verb phrase that describes the property a
    /// value matching, respectively not matching, this matcher should have.
    /// The subject of the verb phrase is the value being matched.
    ///
    /// The output appears next to `Expected` in an assertion failure message.
    /// For example:
    ///
    /// ```text
    /// Value of: ...
    /// Expected: is equal to 7
    ///           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    /// Actual: ...
    /// ```
    ///
    /// When the matcher contains one or more inner matchers, the implementation
    /// should invoke [`Self::describe`] on the inner matchers to complete the
    /// description. It should place the inner description at a point where a
    /// verb phrase would fit. For example, the matcher
    /// [`some`][crate::matchers::some] implements `describe` as follows:
    ///
    /// ```ignore
    /// fn describe(&self, matcher_result: MatcherResult) -> String {
    ///     match matcher_result {
    ///         MatcherResult::Matches => {
    ///             format!("has a value which {}", self.inner.describe(MatcherResult::Matches))
    ///               //  Inner matcher invocation: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    ///         MatcherResult::DoesNotMatch => {...} // Similar to the above
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The output expectation differs from that of
    /// [`explain_match`][Self::explain_match] in that it is a verb phrase
    /// (beginning with a verb like "is") rather than a relative clause
    /// (beginning with "which" or "whose"). This difference is because the
    /// output of `explain_match` is always used adjectivally to describe the
    /// actual value, while `describe` is used in contexts where a relative
    /// clause would not make sense.
    fn describe(&self, matcher_result: MatcherResult) -> String;

    /// Prepares a [`MatchExplanation`] describing how the expected value
    /// encoded in this instance matches or does not match the given value
    /// `actual`.
    ///
    /// This should be in the form of a relative clause, i.e. something starting
    /// with a relative pronoun such as "which" or "whose". It will appear next
    /// to the actual value in an assertion failure. For example:
    ///
    /// ```text
    /// Value of: ...
    /// Expected: ...
    /// Actual: ["Something"], which does not contain "Something else"
    ///                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The default implementation relies on [`describe`][Self::describe]. Thus
    /// it does not make any use of the actual value itself, but rather only
    /// whether the value is matched.
    ///
    /// Override the default implementation to provide additional context on why
    /// a particular value matched or did not match. For example, the
    /// [`container_eq`][crate::matchers::container_eq] matcher displays
    /// information on which elements of the actual value were not present in
    /// the expected value and vice versa.
    ///
    /// This implementation should be overridden in any matcher which contains
    /// one or more inner matchers. The implementation should invoke
    /// `explain_match` on the inner matchers, so that the generated match
    /// explanation also reflects their implementation. Without this, the match
    /// explanation of the inner matchers will not be able to make use of the
    /// actual value at all.
    ///
    /// For example, the `explain_match` implementation of the matcher
    /// [`points_to`][crate::matchers::points_to] defers immediately to the
    /// inner matcher and appears as follows:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// fn explain_match<'a>(&self, actual: &Self::ActualT<'a>) -> MatchExplanation {
    ///     self.expected.explain_match(actual.deref())
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The matcher can also provide some additional context before deferring to
    /// an inner matcher. In that case it should invoke `explain_match` on the
    /// inner matcher at a point where a relative clause would fit. For example:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// fn explain_match<'a>(&self, actual: &'a Self::ActualT<'a>) -> MatchExplanation {
    ///     MatchExplanation::create(
    ///         format!("which points to a value {}", self.expected.explain_match(actual.deref()))
    ///             //   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Expands to "points to a value which ..."
