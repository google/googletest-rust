A rich test assertion library for Rust.

This library provides:

 * A framework for writing matchers which can be combined to make a wide
   range of assertions on data,
 * A rich set of matchers, and
 * A new set of test assertion macros.
## Learning resources

If you're just getting started with `googletest`, consider going through
the first chapter of
["Advanced testing for Rust applications"](https://github.com/mainmatter/rust-advanced-testing-workshop),
a self-guided Rust course: it provides a guided introduction to the library,
with exercises to help you get comfortable with `googletest` macros,
its matchers and its overall philosophy.

## Assertions and matchers

The core of GoogleTest is its *matchers*. Matchers indicate what aspect of an
actual value one is asserting: (in-)equality, containment, regular expression
matching, and so on.

To make an assertion using a matcher, GoogleTest offers three macros:

 * [`assert_that!`] panics if the assertion fails, aborting the test.
 * [`expect_that!`] logs an assertion failure, marking the test as having
   failed, but allows the test to continue running (called a _non-fatal
   assertion_). It requires the use of the [`gtest`]
   attribute macro on the test itself.
 * [`verify_that!`] has no side effects and evaluates to a [`Result`] whose
   `Err` variant describes the assertion failure, if there is one. In
   combination with the
   [`?` operator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/operator-expr.html#the-question-mark-operator),
   this can be used to abort the test on assertion failure without panicking. It
   is also the building block for the other two macros above.

For example:

```
use googletest::prelude::*;

# /* The attribute macro would prevent the function from being compiled in a doctest.
#[test]
# */
fn fails_and_panics() {
    let value = 2;
    assert_that!(value, eq(4));
}

# /* The attribute macro would prevent the function from being compiled in a doctest.
#[gtest]
# */
fn two_logged_failures() {
    let value = 2;
    expect_that!(value, eq(4)); // Test now failed, but continues executing.
    expect_that!(value, eq(5)); // Second failure is also logged.
}

# /* The attribute macro would prevent the function from being compiled in a doctest.
#[test]
# */
fn fails_immediately_without_panic() -> Result<()> {
    let value = 2;
    verify_that!(value, eq(4))?; // Test fails and aborts.
    verify_that!(value, eq(2))?; // Never executes.
    Ok(())
}

# /* The attribute macro would prevent the function from being compiled in a doctest.
#[test]
# */
fn simple_assertion() -> Result<()> {
    let value = 2;
    verify_that!(value, eq(4)) // One can also just return the last assertion.
}
```

Matchers are composable:

```
use googletest::prelude::*;

# /* The attribute macro would prevent the function from being compiled in a doctest.
#[gtest]
# */
fn contains_at_least_one_item_at_least_3() {
# googletest::internal::test_outcome::TestOutcome::init_current_test_outcome();
    let value = vec![1, 2, 3];
    expect_that!(value, contains(ge(&3)));
# googletest::internal::test_outcome::TestOutcome::close_current_test_outcome::<&str>(Ok(()))
#     .unwrap();
}
# contains_at_least_one_item_at_least_3();
```

They can also be logically combined, with methods from [`MatcherBase`]:

```
use googletest::prelude::*;

# /* The attribute macro would prevent the function from being compiled in a doctest.
#[gtest]
# */
fn strictly_between_9_and_11() {
# googletest::internal::test_outcome::TestOutcome::init_current_test_outcome();
    let value = 10;
    expect_that!(value, gt(9).and(not(ge(11))));
# googletest::internal::test_outcome::TestOutcome::close_current_test_outcome::<&str>(Ok(()))
#     .unwrap();
}
# strictly_between_9_and_11();
```

## Writing matchers

One can extend the library by writing additional matchers. To do so, create
a struct holding the matcher's data and have it implement the traits
[`Matcher`] and  [`MatcherBase`]:

```no_run
use googletest::{description::Description, matcher::{Matcher, MatcherBase, MatcherResult}};
use std::fmt::Debug;

#[derive(MatcherBase)]
struct MyEqMatcher<T> {
    expected: T,
}

impl<T: PartialEq + Debug + Copy> Matcher<T> for MyEqMatcher<T> {
    fn matches(&self, actual: T) -> MatcherResult {
        if self.expected == actual {
            MatcherResult::Match
        } else {
            MatcherResult::NoMatch
        }
    }

    fn describe(&self, matcher_result: MatcherResult) -> Description {
        match matcher_result {
            MatcherResult::Match => {
                format!("is equal to {:?} the way I define it", self.expected).into()
            }
            MatcherResult::NoMatch => {
                format!("isn't equal to {:?} the way I define it", self.expected).into()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

 It is recommended to expose a function which constructs the matcher:

 ```no_run
 # use googletest::{description::Description, matcher::{Matcher, MatcherBase, MatcherResult}};
 # use std::fmt::Debug;
 # #[derive(MatcherBase)]
 # struct MyEqMatcher<T> {
 #    expected: T,
 # }
 #
 # impl<T: PartialEq + Debug + Copy> Matcher<T> for MyEqMatcher<T> {
 #    fn matches(&self, actual: T) -> MatcherResult {
 #        if self.expected == actual {
 #            MatcherResult::Match
 #        } else {
 #            MatcherResult::NoMatch
 #        }
 #    }
 #
 #    fn describe(&self, matcher_result: MatcherResult) -> Description {
 #        match matcher_result {
 #            MatcherResult::Match => {
 #                format!("is equal to {:?} the way I define it", self.expected).into()
 #            }
 #            MatcherResult::NoMatch => {
 #                format!("isn't equal to {:?} the way I define it", self.expected).into()
 #            }
 #        }
 #    }
 # }
 #
 pub fn eq_my_way<T: PartialEq + Debug + Copy>(expected: T) -> impl Matcher<T> {
    MyEqMatcher { expected }
 }
 ```

 The new matcher can then be used in the assertion macros:

```
# use googletest::prelude::*;
# use googletest::{description::Description, matcher::{Matcher, MatcherBase, MatcherResult}};
# use std::fmt::Debug;
# #[derive(MatcherBase)]
# struct MyEqMatcher<T> {
#    expected: T,
# }
#
# impl<T: PartialEq + Debug + Copy> Matcher<T> for MyEqMatcher<T> {
#    fn matches(&self, actual: T) -> MatcherResult {
#        if self.expected == actual {
#            MatcherResult::Match
#        } else {
#            MatcherResult::NoMatch
#        }
#    }
#
#    fn describe(&self, matcher_result: MatcherResult) -> Description {
#        match matcher_result {
#            MatcherResult::Match => {
#                format!("is equal to {:?} the way I define it", self.expected).into()
#            }
#            MatcherResult::NoMatch => {
#                format!("isn't equal to {:?} the way I define it", self.expected).into()
#            }
#        }
#    }
# }
#
# pub fn eq_my_way<T: PartialEq + Debug + Copy>(expected: T) -> impl Matcher<T> {
#    MyEqMatcher { expected }
# }
# /* The attribute macro would prevent the function from being compiled in a doctest.
#[gtest]
# */
fn should_be_equal_by_my_definition() {
# googletest::internal::test_outcome::TestOutcome::init_current_test_outcome();
    expect_that!(10, eq_my_way(10));
# googletest::internal::test_outcome::TestOutcome::close_current_test_outcome::<&str>(Ok(()))
#     .unwrap();
}
# should_be_equal_by_my_definition();
```

## Non-fatal assertions

Using non-fatal assertions, a single test is able to log multiple assertion
failures. Any single assertion failure causes the test to be considered
having failed, but execution continues until the test completes or otherwise
aborts.

To make a non-fatal assertion, use the macro [`expect_that!`]. The test must
also be marked with [`gtest`] instead of the Rust-standard `#[test]`.

```no_run
use googletest::prelude::*;

#[gtest]
fn three_non_fatal_assertions() {
    let value = 2;
    expect_that!(value, eq(2));  // Passes; test still considered passing.
    expect_that!(value, eq(3));  // Fails; logs failure and marks the test failed.
    expect_that!(value, eq(4));  // A second failure, also logged.
}
```

This can be used in the same tests as `verify_that!`, in which case the test
function must also return [`Result<()>`]:

```no_run
use googletest::prelude::*;

# /* Make sure this also compiles as a doctest.
#[gtest]
# */
fn failing_non_fatal_assertion() -> Result<()> {
    let value = 2;
    expect_that!(value, eq(3));  // Just marks the test as having failed.
    verify_that!(value, eq(2))?;  // Passes, so does not abort the test.
    Ok(())        // Because of the failing expect_that! call above, the
                  // test fails despite returning Ok(())
}
```

```no_run
use googletest::prelude::*;

#[gtest]
fn failing_fatal_assertion_after_non_fatal_assertion() -> Result<()> {
    let value = 2;
    expect_that!(value, eq(2));  // Passes; test still considered passing.
    verify_that!(value, eq(3))?; // Fails and aborts the test.
    expect_that!(value, eq(3));  // Never executes, since the test already aborted.
    Ok(())
}
```

## Predicate assertions

The macro [`verify_pred!`] provides predicate assertions analogous to
GoogleTest's `EXPECT_PRED` family of macros. Wrap an invocation of a
predicate in a `verify_pred!` invocation to turn that into a test assertion
which passes precisely when the predicate returns `true`:

```
# use googletest::prelude::*;
fn stuff_is_correct(x: i32, y: i32) -> bool {
    x == y
}

# fn run_test() -> Result<()> {
let x = 3;
let y = 4;
verify_pred!(stuff_is_correct(x, y))?;
# Ok(())
# }
# run_test().unwrap_err();
```

The assertion failure message shows the arguments and the values to which
they evaluate:

```text
stuff_is_correct(x, y) was false with
  x = 3,
  y = 4
```

The `verify_pred!` invocation evaluates to a [`Result<()>`] just like
[`verify_that!`]. There is also a macro [`expect_pred!`] to make a non-fatal
predicaticate assertion.

## Unconditionally generating a test failure

The macro [`fail!`] unconditionally evaluates to a `Result` indicating a
test failure. It can be used analogously to [`verify_that!`] and
[`verify_pred!`] to cause a test to fail, with an optional formatted
message:

```
# use googletest::prelude::*;
# /* The attribute macro would prevent the function from being compiled in a doctest.
#[test]
# */
fn always_fails() -> Result<()> {
    fail!("This test must fail with {}", "today")
}
# always_fails().unwrap_err();
```

## Conversion from `Result::Err` and `Option::None`

To simplify error management during a test arrangement, [`Result<T>`]
provides a few conversion utilities.

If your setup function returns `std::result::Result<T, E>` where `E: std::error::Error`,
the `std::result::Result<T, E>` can simply be handled with the `?` operator. If an `Err(e)`
is returned, the test will report a failure at the line where the `?` operator has been
applied (or the lowest caller without `#[track_caller]`).

```
# use googletest::prelude::*;
struct PngImage { h: i32, w: i32 /* ... */ }
impl PngImage {
  fn new_from_file(file_name: &str) -> std::result::Result<Self, std::io::Error> {
    Err(std::io::Error::new(std::io::ErrorKind::Other, "oh no!"))

   }
  fn rotate(&mut self) { std::mem::swap(&mut self.h, &mut self.w);}
  fn dimensions(&self) -> (i32, i32) { (self.h, self.w)}
}

fn test_png_image_dimensions() -> googletest::Result<()> {
  // Arrange
  let mut png = PngImage::new_from_file("example.png")?;
  verify_eq!(png.dimensions(), (128, 64))?;

  // Act
  png.rotate();

  // Assert
  expect_eq!(png.dimensions(), (64, 128));
  Ok(())
}

# test_png_image_dimensions().unwrap_err();
```

If your setup function returns `Option<T>` or `std::result::Result<T, E>` where
`E: !std::error::Error`, then you can convert these types with `or_fail()`
from the `OrFail` extension trait.

```
# use googletest::prelude::*;
# struct PngImage;
# static PNG_BINARY: [u8;0] = [];

impl PngImage {
  fn new_from_binary(bin: &[u8]) -> std::result::Result<Self, String> {
    Err("Parsing failed".into())
  }
}

# /* The attribute macro would prevent the function from being compiled in a doctest.
#[gtest]
# */
fn test_png_image_binary() -> googletest::Result<()> {
  // Arrange
  let png_image = PngImage::new_from_binary(&PNG_BINARY).or_fail()?;
  /* ... */
  # Ok(())
}
# test_png_image_binary().unwrap_err();

impl PngImage {
  fn new_from_cache(key: u64) -> Option<Self> {
    None
  }
}

# /* The attribute macro would prevent the function from being compiled in a doctest.
#[gtest]
# */
fn test_png_from_cache() -> googletest::Result<()> {
  // Arrange
  let png_image = PngImage::new_from_cache(123).or_fail()?;
  /* ... */
  # Ok(())
}
# test_png_from_cache().unwrap_err();
```


## Multi-threaded tests

Due to internal use of thread-local storage, the `expect_*` family of macros
should only be invoked from the same thread as that running the test itself.
`verify_*` and `assert_*` macros on the other hand may be called from other
threads.

## Integrations with other crates

GoogleTest Rust includes integrations with the
[Proptest](https://crates.io/crates/proptest) crates to simplify turning
GoogleTest assertion failures into Proptest
[`TestCaseError`](https://docs.rs/proptest/latest/proptest/test_runner/enum.TestCaseError.html)
through the `?` operator.
